            on the screen that shows this. This means that players will be able to pick up and use items at their disposal. In the second picture, you'll see the enemies of the game, who will attack you when they get close. You'll be able to kill them with the weapon
            you have equipped at that time. When they damage you, it will also drop your on screen healthbar, to show you have taken damage. In the last picture, you can see an interactable healthpack item which you can use to heal yourself.
